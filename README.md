# <Code Execution Guide>
#
# To Execute the code, open up MATLAB and load 'Optimization_C.m'
# In MATLAB, add the path of all subdirectories included in the package.
# Change the inputs for Space Launch Vehicle Design in 'Write_Inputs.m' if necessary.
# Change the optimization-related inputs in 'Optimization_C.m'
# Run the code by pressing 'F5' after placing the cursor in the editor window.
# If optimization is completed, check the outputs by double-clicking 'Outputs' in the workspace window.
